Flask-ProjectManager
====================

This is a command line tool that will create a new Flask application with the ability to create a simple setup or if you are using blueprints.

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

Built with Python 2.7

* * *

## Installing ##

    pip install Flask-NewProject

## Usage Commands ##

For a skeleton structure:
    flask-skeleton ProjectName

This will create a simple skeleton structure with app.py created but with no content inside of it.

For a simple structure:
    flask-simple ProjecName

This is the same as the skeleton structure with the addition of basic content in app.py and a test.py in the test directory. You can also run flask-simple right after flask-skeleton and it will add the basic setup into app.py as well.

* * *

## Running Tests ##

Testing your new simple-structure
I use nosetests from the project folder and run
    nosetests

There are two built in tests with flask-simple. One the check response code 200 and the other is for Hello World!
